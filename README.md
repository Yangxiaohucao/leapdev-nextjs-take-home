Please implement the following:

1. Use a component library to make the UI and UX more appealing and user friendly.

Answer: I have chosed shadcn/ui because it's fast to overwrite and build UI and very customizable and its based on Tailwind CSS

2. Implement dark mode that includes a switcher to go back to light mode.

3. Deleting a book displays a JavaScript alert. Replace this with modern UX.

4. Add a rating system that goes up to 5 stars.

5. There is a bug in the code. Find it and fix it.

[Explain here what the bug was and how you fixed it]

Good luck and have fun!
